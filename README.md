# BQ-automation
python script to automate table migration from old schema to new schema.

From different markets CANADA; MEXICO; GUATEMALA; CHILE;
we have to migrate old data sets on bigquery to new dataset as we deploy a modern data pipeline. 
This will be a huge effort to do manually so i automated this.

on GCP console you need to get your Oauth2 token and save it on same folder as this script with the name "credential-dev.json"
